#### Template for a jumping and flipping animation based on a course section from George Lomidze, co-founder at "Code and Create"

###### This was built to be a reference for bending/jumping/flipping animation. It is not intended to be used as-is, but rather serve as a template that can be used to create a quick CSS animation.

###### This will be changed as part of deliberate practice so if you are following me on my journey expect it to be randomly updated as I come up with different ideas.
